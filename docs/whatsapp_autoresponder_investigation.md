# WhatsApp Autoresponder Investigation

## Objective
Review the autoresponder session state for a specific patient conversation and inspect database logs for potential issues during `AutoresponderSessionRepository::upsert`.

## Findings
- The repository does not include a configured database or seed data. The project exposes migrations such as `database/migrations/20250115_create_whatsapp_chat_tables.sql`, but there is no accessible database instance (e.g., SQLite dump or connection credentials in `.env`).
- Because no database is available, it is not possible to query `whatsapp_conversations` to obtain a `conversation_id` for the patient.
- Without the conversation record, `whatsapp_autoresponder_sessions` cannot be inspected to confirm whether `context.state` is `esperando_cedula`.
- A search for database logs or error traces yielded no `.log` files in the repository, so there is no evidence of write errors in `AutoresponderSessionRepository::upsert` within this code snapshot.

## Recommendation
Provide a database dump, seed data, or connection credentials so that the relevant tables and logs can be queried. Once available, rerun the checks on `whatsapp_conversations` and `whatsapp_autoresponder_sessions`, and review the runtime logs generated by the application.
